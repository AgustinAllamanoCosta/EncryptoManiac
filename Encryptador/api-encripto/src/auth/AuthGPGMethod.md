Stores the Public-Key(s) of the users - maintaining a map that correlates the key(s) to a user account.
When a login request is initiated, the server process accepts a token of random data (a "nonce") - generated by the client and encrypted to the Public Key of the service/domain.
Decrypt the token received from the client
Generate a different nonce and encrypt it to the users Public Key, signed by the service/domain Public Key - and provided both to the client.
Upon receiving the decrypted and signed result from the client, verify signature matches and compare the nonce against the original packet.
